## Project Description

This assignment is aimed at the development of an interactive application prototype following a usercentred design methodology. 
The prototype shall be functional; however, simplifications may be done as the focus of the assignment is on the methods used along the process and the User Interface (UI) and not on having a fully functional
application (leave out most of backend implementation).

Our project is based on an helper app for library functions, such as reserving a locker, reserving a room and finding a specific books in UA's library
